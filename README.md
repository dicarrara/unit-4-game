Help Frank to Collect notes

- There will be four notes displayed on the page.
- The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
- When the player clicks on a note it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.
- The player wins the game if their total score matches the random number and the player loses the game if their total score goes above the random number.
- The amount of points each note adds is not shown to the player, but their total score is displayed and updated after each note is clicked.
- The number of games won and lost will be displayed.
- If the player successfully matches their total score to the random number they get 1 win, if the player's total score is above the random number the player get 1 loss, either way the game restarts.
- When the game is restarted, the player will be shown a new random number, all the crystals will now have 4 different 
hidden values, and the player's total score is reset to 0.

Game design note:
The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120
Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12
